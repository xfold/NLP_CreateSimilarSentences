# Installation and Requirements (python >= 3.7)
### 1. Create the virtual environment and requirements.txt file
First, create a virtual environment using python3.7 (or higher) to not mess with the local python libraries. The virtual environment is not included in the project because of size. To do so in bash:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
And in powershell:
```powershell
py -m venv .venv
.venv\scripts\activate
```
Once the virtual enviroment is created, we can install the project requirements included in the file `requirements.txt` using `pip`:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
